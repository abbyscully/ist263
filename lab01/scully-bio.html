        I am a Television, Radio, and Film major at Syracuse University in Newhouse School of Communications with a minor in Information Technologies. I am interested in being a technical director for live broadcasts. 
        I currently work as a TD at WKTV Newschannel 2 in Utica, NY. I have previously interned at Lionsgate/ Great Point Studios in Yonkers and NBC at 30 Rock as a Media Tech Studio Operations intern. I learned about different aspects of production at both with both companies. Also, I interned at a consumer insights company. 
        I like to watch tv shows, my favorite being Arrested Development and spend time with my family, especially my dog Oliver!
