    <h1>Abaigeal Scully Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I am currently a senior at Syracuse University. I transferred, during COVID, after my Freshman year at Hofstra University. I am currently majoring in Television, Radio, and Film and minoring in Information Management & Technology. I will be graduating in May. I hope to work as a technical director in live TV. I have worked in a small market using Ross Overdrive automation to direct live newscasts for about 4 years in Utica, NY. I also technical direct the events we have on air throughout the year including the Boilermaker Road Race, St. Patrickâ€™s Day Parade, Utica University Teddy Bear Toss Hockey Game, and more. I have interned with NBC at 30 Rock in NYC as a Media Tech and more specifically focusing on Studio Operations where I was able to shadow multiple positions and events including the NY gubernatorial debate. I have also interned at Great Point Studios in Yonkers as a production intern and more. I love technical directing, especially in news because there are always new challenges and technology to learn. </p>
